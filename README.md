# 🍽️ NYC Restaurant Inspection Analysis

This project analyzes NYC restaurant inspection data to identify trends in food safety violations, grade outcomes, and hygiene performance across boroughs and cuisines using Python, SQL, and Power BI.

## 📌 Business Problem

New York City conducts thousands of restaurant inspections every year, generating a large amount of data. However, this data is not easily understandable for restaurant owners, public health officials, or customers without proper analysis.

The goal of this project is to analyze NYC restaurant inspection records to:
- Identify trends in violations and inspection grades
- Compare hygiene performance across boroughs and cuisine types
- Determine what factors lead to poor inspection results
- Provide insights that support better decisions for restaurant owners, city agencies, and consumers.

## 🔍 What This Project Answers

This project addresses the following key questions:
- Which boroughs have better or worse hygiene performance?
- Which cuisine types have the worst inspection grades?
- What are the most common violations linked to poor grades?
- Which restaurants repeatedly perform poorly?
- Are there seasonal or time trends in inspection performance?

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies

- **Python** – Data cleaning and preprocessing  
- **SQL** – Data analysis and querying  
- **Power BI** – Dashboard creation and visualization  

## 📊 Dashboard Overview

The Power BI dashboard includes 5 main visual sections:

1. **NYC Restaurant Hygiene Overview** – KPI summary  
2. **Average Restaurant Hygiene by Borough**  
3. **Average Hygiene Score by Cuisine Type**  
4. **Top 10 Most Common Food Safety Violations**  
5. **Restaurant Inspection Trends Over Time**  

(Planned: NYC Restaurant Risk Level Distribution)

## 📈 Key Findings

### Borough Performance
- Queens has the worst hygiene performance with an average inspection score of **26.11**.
- Staten Island performs best with an average score of **21.88**.

### High-Risk Cuisines
Cuisines with the worst average grade scores include:
- Basque: 1.93  
- Creole: 1.89  
- African: 1.74  
- Indian: 1.72  

(Grade scale: A = 1, B = 2, C = 3)

### Common Factors Behind Poor Grades
Violations most associated with B & C grades:
- Rodent and pest infestation (08A, 04L)
- Improper food temperature control (02G, 02B)
- Unsanitary food contact surfaces (06D)

### Repeat Offender Restaurants
Top restaurants with repeated poor inspection results:
- Mee Sum Cafe – 37 bad inspections
- Da Pai Don – 33 bad inspections
- The Coppola Cafe – 31 bad inspections

### Time-Based Trends
- October has the highest inspection volume.
- Worst inspection scores occurred during mid-2025, especially July–August.

## 🚀 Future Improvements

- Predict restaurant inspection grades using machine learning
- Add live data updates from NYC Open Data
- Create neighborhood-level risk heatmaps
- Link customer reviews with inspection scores
